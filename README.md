# AD-WaveNet #
A network that integrates the Discrete 2D Wavelet Transform (DWT) with adaptive attention mechanisms to enhance sparse image reconstruction.

Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) provide high-contrast and high-resolution biomedical images at rapid speeds. However, the quality of PAT images is sig- nificantly influenced by the sampling density. Sparse sampling can greatly reduce equipment costs but leads to image artifacts and quality degradation. Deep learning models have greatly improved sparse PAT imaging, but their high computational demands restrict their application in settings with limited resources. To address this limitation, we propose AD-WaveNet, a lightweight network integrated the Discrete 2D Wavelet Transform (DWT) with adaptive attention mechanisms to enhance sparse image reconstruction while reducing computational complexity. Attention mechanisms are specifically designed to leverage the multi-scale decomposition properties of DWT, effectively emphasizing key features at different scales. Compared to the latest models, AD-WaveNet achieves a reduction in computational complexity and parameter count by approximately two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, AD-WaveNet also provides optimal reconstruction quality, demonstrating its great potential for practical PAT imaging applications.
